            F!!! This game
            Guess I don't know how to play
            I'll play it anyway
            Todays another day to cry about
            Dying away 
            I'll be coming for those runes anyway

            Elden ring (Elden ring)
            Grace respawn (Elden ring)
            I'm so done
            For an hour or two

            Just dodge attacks they say 
            But bosses feel like
            They all cheating
            Rolling away 
            Slowly learning that dying is okay
            Stay on your steed 
            It's always better just to summon something

            Elden ring (Elden ring)
            Praise the rump (Praise the rump)
            Liar ahead
            Behold Dog
